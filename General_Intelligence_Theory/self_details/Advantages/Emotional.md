## EMOTIONAL
    - Good in emotional manipulation(through perspective shift)
    - I reason/get idea when i ask question and answer myself.
    - I reason brillently when the feeddback tells that the problem is about truth finding ,important and has consequence and changes the understanding(basically i need emotional surge for better performance)
