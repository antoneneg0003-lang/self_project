    #Note > Talent in switching ,combining and in-depth usage (know when to switch ,combine and use deeply)

## BROAD
    - Patience
    - Tolerance 
        - High > pain,difficulty,intensity
        - Low  > non-sense
    - Endurance and Resilence(mental and physical) ->Shines in adversity
    - Persistence
        - High > when problems are high stake/truth finding/transformation/real consequences
        - Low  > Low only when the problem feels pointless

## EMOTIONAL
    - Good in emotional manipulation(through perspective shift)
    - I reason/get idea when i ask question and answer myself.
    - I reason brillently when the feeddback tells that the problem is about truth finding ,important and has consequence and changes the understanding(basically i need emotional surge for better performance)
