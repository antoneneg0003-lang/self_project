# Problem:
Reduced independent reasoning ability due to passive LLM consumption

- Passive thinking
- Overreliance
- Shallow pattern recognition
- Weak problem decomposition skill


↓


# Self-development Goal:
Use LLM to amplify reasoning, not replace it.


↓


# Cause:
- Negligence in usage
- Absence of structured usage rule ("For what", "When", "How")
- LLM-first thinking pattern


↓


# Core Principle:
YOU = Primary Thinker
LLM = Critic + Clarifier + Challenger
NOT = Replacement Brain


↓


# Solution Framework


## For What
1. Deepening Conceptual Understanding
2. Stress-testing and Improving Ideas


## When
1. After attempting independently
2. When you need critique, expansion, or correction
3. When no high-quality feedback source is available


## How


====================================================================
INFORMATION MODE (Concept Learning Algorithm)
====================================================================

Step 0: Independent Attempt (Mandatory)
- Write your current understanding.
- Define the concept in your own words.
- Give examples.
- List doubts.

Step 1: Ask for Critique (NOT explanation first)
- Provide your understanding.
- Ask LLM: "What is wrong, incomplete, or inaccurate?"

Step 2: Request Structural Expansion
- Ask for formal definition.
- Ask for edge cases.
- Ask for counterexamples.
- Ask for common misconceptions.

Step 3: Reconstruct From Memory
- Close reference.
- Rewrite concept cleanly without assistance.

Step 4: External Verification
- Check trusted sources (textbook, documentation, research).
- Confirm LLM corrections are valid.

Step 5: Application Test
- Solve a new problem.
- Generate a new example.
- Explain to an imaginary beginner.

Stop Condition:
When you can explain and apply without assistance.
NOT when LLM says "100% accurate."


====================================================================
IDEA MODE (Idea Refinement Algorithm)
====================================================================

Step 0: Develop Idea Independently
- Write full idea clearly.
- Define goal, constraints, assumptions.
- Provide examples or structure.

Step 1: Ask LLM to Challenge It
- Ask for weaknesses.
- Ask for hidden assumptions.
- Ask for edge cases.
- Ask for logical gaps.

Step 2: Strengthen Idea Yourself
- Modify based on critique.
- Clarify structure.
- Remove weak parts.

Step 3: Stress Test
- Ask LLM for counterarguments.
- Ask: "In what scenarios would this fail?"

Step 4: Refine Again Independently

Step 5: Final Validation
- Evaluate coherence, feasibility, and logical consistency.

Stop Condition:
When idea withstands counterarguments and remains coherent.


↓


# Skill Needed:
- Meta-cognitive monitoring (Am I thinking first?)
- Tolerance for cognitive effort
- Ability to detect dependency patterns


↓


# Activity Rule:
Every time you use LLM:
1. Attempt independently first.
2. Use LLM for critique, not substitution.
3. Verify important information externally.
4. Apply without assistance.
