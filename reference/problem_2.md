# Problem :Inefficient Note Taking System 

↓

# Self-development goal:
Use  Note Taking System as Reinforment for future learning 

↓

# Cause:
- Ignorance
- Absence of Structured rule such that it reinforces learning

↓

# Core  Principle
## Elements
    - Prototype(Notebook/md file)
    - Storage system(github/note book)
    - Author and user
## Operations/Rules
    - Author Write the prototype
    - Author Confirm and format
    - Author Store
    - Author Modify
    - User Learn from the Note
## Constraints
- Should be easy modifiable
- Should be easy to verify and format
- Should be easy to track changes
- Easy to store
- Easy to understand and reinforce for the user

# Solution Framework(Method/Algorithm/system)
- Cluster the Note into any of these category
    - Long or short Note
    - Will be modified often or Will not be modified or will be modifed rarely
    - Good Formating help for more clarity or Good Formating is redundant
    - Track changes or don't wnat to track changes
- Rule
    - Long->github
    - Short->notebook
    - Will be modified often ->github
    - Will not be modified->Notebook
    - will be modifed rarely->then it depend on other paramenter(eg:long vs short,etc)
    - Need good formating->Github
    - No need for good formating->notebook
    - Want to track changes->Github
    - Don't want to track changes->notebook

# Skill Needed to efficiently use the solution:
- Rapid and confident categorisation of notes using predefined rules


# Activity to practive the skill
- Every time a note is created, classify it within 10 seconds using predefined rules.
- Do not reconsider after storing.
