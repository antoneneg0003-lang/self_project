PROBLEM → PURPOSE → GOAL → CAUSE → SOLUTION → SKILL NEEDED → PRACTICE ACTIVITY

1) PROBLEM
   = The gap between current state and desired state.

2) PURPOSE
   = Why solve this problem at all? (the reason it matters)

3) GOAL
   = What specific outcome will close the gap / remove the problem?

4) CAUSE (Root Cause)
   = Why does the problem exist?

5) SOLUTION
   = What method/intervention removes the root cause?

6) SKILL NEEDED
   = What capability is required to apply the solution correctly/efficiently?

7) PRACTICE ACTIVITY
   = What repeatable activity builds that skill?

EXAMPLE
Problem: I can’t tell what thinking mode I’m using in the moment.
Purpose: Improve clarity + efficiency in my problem solving.
Goal: Identify my thinking mode correctly in real time in 80% of cases.
Cause: No explicit taxonomy + no practice labeling.
Solution: Build a thinking-mode map + add a labeling step after each session.
Skill needed: Rapid recognition + metacognitive labeling.
Practice activity: After every task, write: (mode used → evidence → what I missed).
