# Purpose vs Goal
## Purpose
- Definition:Purpose is the fundamental reason an action exists.It defines the direction or intended benefit behind the action.

- It answers:
Why is this being done at all?

It is broad and not necessarily measurable.

- Example:
                
Action: Exercising

Purpose:
→ To maintain long-term physical health.

That is the reason the action exists.

## Goal
- Definition:
A goal is a specific, clearly defined outcome you aim to achieve within the direction set by the purpose.

- It answers:

What exact result am I trying to reach?

It is concrete and usually measurable.

- Example

Action: Exercising

Goal:
→ Run 5 km in under 30 minutes within 3 months.

That is a specific target.

## Final Structural Difference

Purpose → Direction (Why)
Goal → Target (What result)

Purpose can exist without a goal.
A goal cannot exist without a purpose.

## Correct Hierarchy

Purpose → explains why the action exists (at a high level)

Goal → defines what specific result the action aims to produce

Action → the behavior you perform

### Clean Structure

Purpose = Why (big reason)

Goal = What outcome

Action = How (execution step)

### Example

You exercise.

Purpose:
→ To maintain long-term health.

Goal:
→ Lose 5 kg in 4 months.

Action:
→ Go to gym 5 days per week.
