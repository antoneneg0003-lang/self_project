# Problem :Inefficient Usage of Material/concept/object/etc(Resource)

↓

# Self development goal:Get maximum benefit from object/Concept/etc using efficient usage rule

↓
# Cause:
- Abundant availability of resources
- Availability of resources when it is not needed
- Absense of structured rule

↓


# Solution framework
- Elements
    - User
    - Object
    - Benefit
    - Rule
- Rule("For what"," whom","when","How")
    - step1:Indentify the purpose of the resource(For what) and for whom
    - step2:Indetify when it could/has to be used
    - step3:Indentify how to use it
    - step4:Allocation of resources based on needs
    - step5:Manage the resource 
    - Step6:If the resource is not currently needed for that particular user then
        - step4.1:Store the resource for future reinforcement
        - step4.2:See how it can help society or support other resources

# Skill Needed for Efficient usage of the solution:

- Automatic and accurate contextual mapping of resources
  (Resource → Purpose → User → Timing(when) → Method(how))
- Resource allocation and management

# Activity Needed to practice that skill and make it into habitual acticty

# Activity Needed to practice the skill:

- Every time you encounter a new resource (material, concept, object, tool):
    1. Immediately map it within 15–30 seconds:
        - For what?
        - For whom?
        - When should it be used?
        - How should it be used?
    2. Decide:
        - Use now
        - Store for later
        - Discard
        - Redirect to someone else
    3. Do not leave the resource in an undefined state.
    4. Allocate and manage based on needs and for efficiencyFor
